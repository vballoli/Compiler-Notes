# Introduction and the Cool Programming Language

There are two approaches to programming languages:

1. Compiler

2. Interpreter

## Interpreter

Interpreter takes the program and data as inputs, and immediately starts running it. It is ONLINE i.e all the work done is a part of running.

## Compilers

A compiler takes program as an input, produces an executable, which could be another programming language, like assembly or bytecode that runs separately on the data. This means that compiler is OFFLINE i.e it pre-processes the program first and then runs on many different outputs.

## History

Started as speedcoder, by John Backus which made developing programs faster, but were 10-20x slower than hand-written programs. Although speedcoding wasn't popular, it led to FORTRAN - Formula Translated Project, one of the most successful high-level language that was widely adopted.

FORTRAN 1 has 5 aspects:

1. Lexical Analysis

2. Parsing

3. Semantic Analysis

4. Optimization

5. Code Generation

1, 2 - Syntactic | 3 - type, scope | 5 - Translation
